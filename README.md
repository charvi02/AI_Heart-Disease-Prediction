The project is titled "Heart Disease Prediction" and aims to develop a machine-learning model based on patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Here's a brief overview of the key aspects:

1. Objective:
   - To create a predictive model using supervised learning algorithms.
   - To assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment for heart disease.

2. Dataset: 
   - Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset includes medical and physiological attributes like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type.
   - Features were cleaned and reduced to retain the most significant attributes for prediction.

3. Tools and Technologies:
   - Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.
   - Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

4. Methodology:
   - Data preprocessing was done to handle missing values and normalize data.
   - Models were trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

5. Outcome:
   - The final model achieved reliable predictive accuracy, offering insights into the key risk factors contributing to heart disease.
   - It provides an interpretable and actionable result for clinical use.

This project highlights the practical application of AI in healthcare, contributing to early detection and prevention strategies.
